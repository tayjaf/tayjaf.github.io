**[Fuel Names](https://github.com/tayjaf/Portfolio/tree/main/2022/FuelNames)**

Fuel Names is a decentralized naming registry built on Fuel. Fuel Names allows users to mint a ".fuel" address, similar to how ENS functions on Ethereum.

How does it work? The goal is to facilitate public address sharing and sending transactions on Fuel.

After creating and connecting your wallet directly on FNS, you will be able to search for the domain of your choice. Mint it and share it with your friends!
